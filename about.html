                    Howdy and welcome!
My mission is to ensure that everyone, regardless of ability, can easily navigate and enjoy digital experiences.
Before diving into the world of design, I spent over 10 years working in the pet industry—a journey that taught me patience, empathy, and a deep appreciation for care and detail. That experience has shaped how I approach design, always keeping the user’s needs at the forefront.
In addition to UX/UI, I’m also a Twitch streamer and have recently started learning to create custom assets for fellow streamers. This side of my work blends creativity and design in a way that feels both fun and rewarding.
I’m excited to combine my love for problem-solving with my commitment to inclusivity as I grow in this field. Thanks for stopping by—I can’t wait to share my work with you!
